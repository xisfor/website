    <h3>Ethical investment platform</h3>
    <p>The goal was to create an engaging and functional web application that used a
      combination of technologies. We created an award-winning site that now helps
      users invest their money with a social conscience.</p>
    <p><small>Built with a proprietary PHP CMS integrated within a Symfony 2 framework.</small></p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-sm-4">
    <h3>Loyalty app</h3>
    <p>This client had a card-based loyalty scheme that needed transforming into a
      cross-platform mobile system. A stable backend with a hybrid frontend
      allowed simultanious rollout across all major mobile platforms.</p>
    <p><small>Built with a Symfony 2 API server and a Phonegap/KnockoutJS multi-platform mobile app.</small></p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-sm-4">
    <h3>Asset management system</h3>
    <p>This system was so valuable it needed to be rescued, not discarded. We
      identified the critical parts, stabilised it through automated testing, and
      optimised it; it now handles hundreds of thousands of assets.</p>
    <p><small>Built with Ruby on Rails and iOS. Scaled using Amazon Web Services.</small></p>
